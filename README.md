# Development of a data pipeline to process publicaly available housing data of London

### Challenge and solution
London’s housing market is characterised by complexity and volatility. With numerous property platforms available in the UK, housing search can be demanding and stressful, especially for people who are still unfamiliar with the city. To address this issue, we created an app that allows user to analyse housing prices based on locations of subway stations. More precisely, users see the average housing price of properties that are within a radius of less than 1km of a particular subway station. Users benefit from an intuitive interface and quickly understand the price levels for their areas of interest. Moreover, the app can feature location-specific information, regarding air pollution, thereby further contributing to facilitated decision-making.

### Under the hood
The app is built on a diverse architecture visible in the illustration above. The architecture is split
up in the following main parts: (1) web scraping, (2) data processing and storing and (3) web app.  &nbsp;
